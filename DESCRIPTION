Title: Accessory Tools for Pre-Processing Hyperspectral Images
Version: 1.0
Date: 2022-03-29
Description: Read and pre-process hyperspectral images. These type of
    sensor data is usually recorded in some raw format. This package
    contains some easy-to-use functions to promptly build the image with
    some basic radiometric calibrations and setting up the spatial information. 
    Geometric correction can be done with band-to-band registration (translation 
    and rotation). Further functionalities allows to compute sliding windows
    statistics over the image.
